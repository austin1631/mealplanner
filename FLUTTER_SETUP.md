# Flutter Setup Guide

Welcome to the Flutter Setup Guide! This document outlines the steps necessary to install and configure Flutter on your system. Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- An internet connection.
- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- At least 2.5 GB of disk space (excluding IDE/tools).
- Tools for your preferred development platform:
  - **Windows**: PowerShell 5.0 or newer (this is pre-installed with Windows 10), Git for Windows.
  - **macOS**: bash, mkdir, rm, git, curl, unzip, which.
  - **Linux**: bash, mkdir, rm, git, curl, unzip, which, xz-utils.

## Installation

### Windows

1. Download the latest Flutter SDK from the [Flutter official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows).
2. Extract the zip file to a desired location (e.g., `C:\src\flutter`).
3. Update your system's environment variables to include the Flutter bin directory (`C:\src\flutter\bin`).
4. Open a new command prompt and run `flutter doctor` to check for any dependencies you might need to install to complete the setup.

### macOS

1. Download the latest Flutter SDK from the [Flutter official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos).
2. Extract the zip file and move the `flutter` folder to your desired location (e.g., `/Users/<your-username>/development/flutter`).
3. Open a terminal and run the following command to add Flutter to your PATH permanently:
   ```sh
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
   ```
4. Run `source ~/.zshrc` to refresh your terminal.
5. Execute `flutter doctor` to check for any dependencies you might need to install.

### Linux

1. Download the latest Flutter SDK from the [Flutter official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux).
2. Extract the zip file to a location like `~/development` by running:
   ```sh
   tar xf ~/Downloads/flutter_linux_*.tar.xz -C ~/development
   ```
3. Add the Flutter tool to your path:
   ```sh
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```
4. Refresh your terminal session with the command `source ~/.bashrc`.
5. Run `flutter doctor` to see if there are any additional dependencies you need to install.

## Verify Installation

After installing Flutter, run the following command in your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell for Windows, Terminal for macOS and Linux):

```sh
flutter doctor
```

This command checks your environment and displays a report to the terminal window. The Flutter team recommends running `flutter doctor` frequently to catch potential issues early.

## IDE Setup

Flutter supports development in various IDEs, but [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are the most popular.

- **Android Studio**: Install the Flutter and Dart plugins to get full support for development.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Install the Flutter extension to get a rich set of tools for Flutter development.

## Creating Your First Flutter Project

To create a new Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
3. Run `flutter create my_app` to create a new Flutter project named `my_app`.
4. Once the project is created, `cd my_app` to enter the project directory.
5. Run `flutter run` to start your app on a connected device or simulator.
